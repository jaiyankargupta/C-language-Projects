1. **Header Files**: 
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    #include <netinet/in.h>
    #include <netdb.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    ```
    These lines include necessary header files for standard input-output operations, memory allocation, string manipulation, socket programming, and network-related functions.

2. **Constants**:
    ```c
    #define API_KEY "yourAPIKey"
    #define API_HOST "api.openweathermap.org"
    #define API_PATH "/data/2.5/weather"
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
    ```
    These lines define constants for the OpenWeatherMap API key, host, API path, and buffer size for storing data received from the server.

3. **Error Handling Function**:
    ```c
    void handleError(const char *msg) {
        perror(msg);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    ```
    This function is used to handle errors during socket creation, server resolution, connection, sending requests, receiving responses, and parsing data. It prints the error message to the standard error stream and exits the program with a failure status.

4. **Print Weather Information Function**:
    ```c
    void printWeatherInfo(const char *json) {
        // Parsing JSON and extracting relevant information
        // Printing weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and country
    }
    ```
    This function parses the JSON response received from the server and extracts relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and country. It then prints this information to the standard output.

5. **Parse HTTP Response Function**:
    ```c
    void parseHTTPResponse(int sockfd) {
        // Receiving and displaying the HTTP response
        // Parsing JSON data from the response and calling printWeatherInfo function
        // Closing the socket
    }
    ```
    This function receives the HTTP response from the server, searches for JSON data within the response, and calls the `printWeatherInfo` function to parse and print the weather information. It closes the socket after processing the response.

6. **Get Weather Function**:
    ```c
    void getWeather(char *location) {
        // Creating a TCP socket
        // Resolving server address
        // Connecting to the server
        // Preparing and sending HTTP request
        // Parsing and displaying HTTP response
    }
    ```
    This function performs the entire process of fetching weather data for a specified location. It creates a TCP socket, resolves the server address, establishes a connection to the server, sends an HTTP request to retrieve weather data, and then parses and displays the HTTP response.

7. **Main Function**:
    ```c
    int main() {
        // Getting user input for location
        // Calling getWeather function to fetch weather data
        // Returning 0 to indicate successful execution
    }
    ```
    This is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter a location, calls the `getWeather` function to fetch weather data for the entered location, and then returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
